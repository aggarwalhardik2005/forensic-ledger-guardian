              <AccordionContent>
                ForensicLedger is a blockchain-based digital evidence management
                system that ensures the integrity and chain of custody of
                forensic evidence through cryptographic verification and
                decentralized storage.

              <AccordionTrigger>How do I submit evidence?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Navigate to the Upload page from the main navigation. You can
                upload digital evidence files, which will be hashed and stored
                securely. The system will guide you through providing necessary
                metadata and case information.

                How can I verify evidence integrity?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Use the Verify page to check evidence integrity. You can upload
                a file to compare its hash with the one recorded on the
                blockchain, or you can browse existing evidence and view its
                complete chain of custody history.

                What roles are available in the system?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                The system supports four main roles: Court (administrator),
                Officer (law enforcement), Forensic (technical specialist), and
                Lawyer (legal representative). Each role has specific
                permissions and workflows tailored to their responsibilities.

                How does the blockchain ensure evidence integrity?
              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                When evidence is uploaded, a cryptographic hash is generated and
                stored on the blockchain. This hash acts as a digital
                fingerprint that can later be used to verify the file hasn't
                been altered. Additionally, all access to evidence is recorded
                in an immutable chain of custody log.
