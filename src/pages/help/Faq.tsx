                <p className="mb-2">
                  ForensicLedger is a blockchain-based platform designed for secure management, verification, 
                  and tracking of digital forensic evidence. It ensures the integrity and chain of custody of 
                  evidence through cryptographic verification and immutable record-keeping.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The platform works by creating cryptographic hashes of evidence files and recording these 
                  hashes on a blockchain ledger, allowing for tamper-evident storage and verification. Each 
                  access or transfer of evidence is recorded, creating a complete and verifiable chain of custody.

                How does blockchain ensure the integrity of evidence?

              <AccordionContent>
                <p className="mb-2">
                  Blockchain technology ensures evidence integrity through several mechanisms:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-2">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Immutability:</strong> Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered 
                    or deleted without detection.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cryptographic Verification:</strong> Evidence files are hashed using secure algorithms, 
                    and these hashes are stored on the blockchain. Any change to the original file would result in 
                    a different hash, immediately flagging tampering.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Distributed Consensus:</strong> Multiple nodes verify and agree on the state of the ledger, 
                    making it extremely difficult to manipulate records.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Timestamping:</strong> All actions are timestamped and recorded in chronological order, 
                    providing a verifiable timeline of evidence handling.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These features combine to create a system where evidence integrity can be mathematically verified, 
                  significantly strengthening the admissibility and reliability of digital evidence in court.
